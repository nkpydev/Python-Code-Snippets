# Python Code Snippets

## Author: Nitin K (nkpydev)

### GitHub: https://github.com/nkpydev

#### Purpose:

> While I am learning Python, I felt I should have few basic examples stacked at one place, so as to not go thr' all webpages [help, Github, Stackoverflow and all other helpful sources] to look into, if needed.

> I am trying to create this mini snippet repository so as to have examples at hand with ease whenever I feel need to take a glance for some reference.

> Hopefully someone else also finds this helpful, if they stumble upon this source.
