# Python Learning #

### Purpose:
I am trying to create this mini notes + snippet repository so as to have notes with examples at hand with ease whenever I feel need to take a glance for some reference.

Hopefully someone else also finds this helpful, if they stumble upon this source.

### Motivation:
I started learning Python after I stumbled upon a pyautogui code from a fellow github member @[unix121](https://github.com/unix121), and directly wanted to learn pyautogui module - lol.. that was July/August 2018.

I am still learning new things - everyday.

This repository is my collection of notes and examples of concepts that I learnt.

I am not a programmer by profession, but I am loving Python.

I intend to learn as much as I can about this awesome language.

The Zen of Python, by Tim Peters

- Beautiful is better than ugly.
- Explicit is better than implicit.
- Simple is better than complex.
- Complex is better than complicated.
- Flat is better than nested.
- Sparse is better than dense.
- Readability counts.
- Special cases aren't special enough to break the rules.
- Although practicality beats purity.
- Errors should never pass silently.
- Unless explicitly silenced.
- In the face of ambiguity, refuse the temptation to guess.
- There should be one-- and preferably only one --obvious way to do it.
- Although that way may not be obvious at first unless you're Dutch.
- Now is better than never.
- Although never is often better than *right* now.
- If the implementation is hard to explain, it's a bad idea.
- If the implementation is easy to explain, it may be a good idea.
- Namespaces are one honking great idea -- let's do more of those!
