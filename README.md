# Python Learning #

### Purpose:
I am trying to create a guide to learn Python, on own.

### Motivation:
I am not a programmer by profession, so lost touch with whatever C, C++, Java I had learnt in my graduation days.

August 2018, I somehow stumbled upon an pyautogui automation script and I realised how long it has been since I actually scripted anything.

Here I will have to accept one very important mistake in my student life - I never ever went out of my lazy way to understand how things are structured, how they work.

I was happy to understand the flow of program.

Never realised as a student - 
-   understanding what data types are
-   how are they stored in memory
-   what is compiler/interpreter

While I am writing all these points, I am realising how bad I was till this point.

Now that I have almost 10 years of actual work experience, I understand how important it is to know things in-and-out.

I don't intend to upgrade myself for better opportunity, but to feel better myself. That I know something better.

This is my attempt to understand and re-write what is already there on Internet, but in my own words, in my own way.


### Inspiration:
1. [Python Docs](https://docs.python.org/3.7/library/index.html)
2. [Google Search](https://www.google.com/)
3. [StackoverFlow](https://stackoverflow.com/)
4. [GeeksforGeeks](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-programming-language/)
5. [PythonSpot](https://pythonspot.com/)

and many more... 

### TO-DO:
-   Add more info on other topics
-   Re-arrange everything accordingly
-   Create a new Generic View/Index kind of Page to start viewing everything.
-   Link all relevent Note Topics to appropriate examples.
