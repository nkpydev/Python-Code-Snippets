# Yield Vs Return - Python!

## Yield:
> Yield statement suspends function's execution and send a value back to caller, but retains enough state to enable
>function to resume where it is left off.
> When resumed, the function continues execution immediately after the last yield run.
> This allows its code to produce a series of values over time, rather than computing them at once and sending them
>back like a list.

## Return:
> Do we need to elaborate this? :)
