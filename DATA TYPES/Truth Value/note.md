# Truth Values:

-   True
-   False

Any object can be tested for Truth Value, for usage in:
-   if 
-   while 
condition, or as operand of the Boolean operations.

By default, an object is considered True unless its class defines either:
1.  \_\_bool\_\_() method that returns False
2.  \_\_len\_\_() method that returns 0(zero)
